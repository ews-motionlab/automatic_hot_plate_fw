# automatic_hot_plate_fw
Firmware for the automatic hot plate for PCB toasting in MotionLab!

# README #

This repository holds the firmware running in the fantastic automatic hot plate of MotionLab!

* The repository contains a project created with PLATFORMIO
* The created code is to be used with the ESP32 soc (very likely over a WEMOS LOLIN board).
* To complete the setup, a COOKING HOT PLATE and temperature sensors are required.
* CAUTION: HOT PLATE MAY BE HOT!

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install VisualStudio Code
* Install Platformio (is a VisualStudio Code plug-in)
* Download the repository
* Platformio --> Open Project --> path_to_project
* The Arduino libraries for the peripherals, may need to be installed externally, for that:
  + Google for the name of the library you're interested and go to its git repository.
  + Download the library and move it to the "Libraries" folder inside this project.
